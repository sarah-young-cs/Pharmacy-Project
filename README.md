This project is a Pharmacy Management System that allows customers to pick up their prescriptions by providing their name and birthday at the pharmacy. The system verifies the customer’s information and distributes the corresponding prescription if it is available. Key features include two-factor authentication for security, automatic stock management, and the implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as polymorphism, aggregation, and inheritance.

Four main test cases have been designed to ensure that the system functions as expected. These include cases where there are no prescriptions in the system, where the customer’s name and birthday do not match the stored information, where the prescription is in stock but the customer cannot be verified, and where the prescription is successfully distributed to the verified customer. These test cases cover the full range of expected behaviors and help ensure that the system operates smoothly in different scenarios.
